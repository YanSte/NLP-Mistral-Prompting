Microsoft invested $16.3 million in the French startup, and it agreed to distribute Mistral Large on its Azure platform and let Mistral AI use Azure computing infrastructure. Mistral AI makes the new models available to try for free here and to use on its La Plateforme and via custom deployments.\n\nModel specs: The new models’ parameter counts, architectures, and training methods are undisclosed. Like the earlier, open source Mistral 7B and Mixtral 8x7B, they can process 32,000 tokens of input context. \n\nMistral Large achieved 81.2 percent on the MMLU benchmark, outperforming Anthropic’s Claude 2, Google’s Gemini Pro, and Meta’s Llama 2 70B, though falling short of GPT-4. Mistral Small, which is optimized for latency and cost, achieved 72.2 percent on MMLU.\nBoth models are fluent in French, German, Spanish, and Italian. They’re trained for function calling and JSON-format output.\nMicrosoft’s investment in Mistral AI is significant but tiny compared to its $13 billion stake in OpenAI and Google and Amazon’s investments in Anthropic, which amount to $2 billion and $4 billion respectively.\nMistral AI and Microsoft will collaborate to train bespoke models for customers including European governments.\nBehind the news: Mistral AI was founded in early 2023 by engineers from Google and Meta. The French government has touted the company as a home-grown competitor to U.S.-based leaders like OpenAI. France’s representatives in the European Commission argued on Mistral’s behalf to loosen the European Union’s AI Act oversight on powerful AI models. \n\nYes, but: Mistral AI’s partnership with Microsoft has divided European lawmakers and regulators. The European Commission, which already was investigating Microsoft’s agreement with OpenAI for potential breaches of antitrust law, plans to investigate the new partnership as well. Members of President Emmanuel Macron’s Renaissance party criticized the deal’s potential to give a U.S. company access to European users’ data. However, other French lawmakers support the relationship.\n\nWhy it matters: The partnership between Mistral AI and Microsoft gives the startup crucial processing power for training large models and greater access to potential customers around the world. It gives the tech giant greater access to the European market. And it gives Azure customers access to a high-performance model that’s tailored to Europe’s unique regulatory environment.\n\nWe’re thinking: Mistral AI has made impressive progress in a short time, especially relative to the resources at its disposal as a startup. Its partnership with a leading hyperscaler is a sign of the tremendous processing and distribution power that remains concentrated in the large, U.S.-headquartered cloud companies.\n\"\"\"","metadata":{"height":336,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2024-05-04T08:14:14.777940Z","iopub.execute_input":"2024-05-04T08:14:14.778839Z","iopub.status.idle":"2024-05-04T08:14:14.789119Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2024-05-04T08:14:14.778793Z","shell.execute_reply":"2024-05-04T08:14:14.787553Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":34,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"prompt = f\"\"\"\nYou are a commentator.

The French startup introduced two new closed models, Mistral Large and Mistral Small, and received a $16.3 million investment from Microsoft. Microsoft will distribute Mistral Large on its Azure platform and collaborate with Mistral AI to train bespoke models for customers, including European governments. Mistral AI's new models outperform some competitors on the MMLU benchmark but fall short of GPT-4. The partnership has divided European lawmakers and regulators, with some expressing concerns about data privacy and antitrust issues.\n\n# Interesting Questions:\n\nQ: How does Mistral AI's performance on the MMLU benchmark compare to other prominent models in the industry?\n\nA: Mistral Large achieved an impressive score of 81.2% on the MMLU benchmark, outperforming Anthropic’s Claude 2, Google’s Gemini Pro, and Meta’s Llama 2 70B. However, it still falls short of GPT-4's performance. This demonstrates that Mistral AI's models are competitive in the market and can provide valuable AI capabilities, but there is still room for improvement to catch up with industry leaders.\n\n<81.2% is a strong score, indicating that Mistral Large is a capable model. However, GPT-4 outperforms it, suggesting that Mistral AI still has work to do to reach the top tier of language models.>\n\nQ: What are the potential implications of the partnership between Mistral AI and Microsoft for European data privacy and antitrust regulations?\n\nA: The partnership between Mistral AI and Microsoft has raised concerns among some European lawmakers and regulators about data privacy and antitrust issues. The European Commission plans to investigate the agreement for potential breaches of antitrust law, and members of President Emmanuel Macron’s Renaissance party have criticized the deal's potential to give a U.S. company access to European users' data. These concerns highlight the challenges of balancing the benefits of AI innovation with the need to protect users' privacy and maintain fair competition in the European market.\n\n<The partnership between Mistral AI and Microsoft may face significant regulatory hurdles in Europe, as data privacy and antitrust concerns take center stage. This situation underscores the importance of addressing these issues proactively to ensure the sustainable growth of the AI industry.>\n\nQ: How does Mistral AI's rapid progress and partnership with a leading hyperscaler reflect the current state of the AI market, particularly in terms of processing power and distribution?\n\nA: Mistral AI has made impressive progress in a short time, especially considering its resources as a startup. Its partnership with a leading hyperscaler like Microsoft highlights the tremendous processing and distribution power that remains concentrated in large, U.S.-headquartered cloud companies. This situation suggests that AI startups may need to form strategic partnerships with these dominant players to access the necessary resources and reach a global customer base.\n\n<Mistral AI's experience illustrates the significant advantages that come with partnering with a leading hyperscaler in the AI market. However, this also raises questions about the distribution of power and resources in the industry, and whether adequate opportunities exist for smaller players and new entrants.>\n\n# Analysis Report:\n\nEuropean AI champion Mistral AI has unveiled new large language models and formed an alliance with Microsoft, marking a significant development in the European AI landscape.
